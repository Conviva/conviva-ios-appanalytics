# Custom event tracking to track your application specific events and state changes
Use trackCustomEvent() to track all kinds of events. This API provides 2 fields to describe the tracked events. 
  * eventName  - Name of the custom event.
  * eventData  â€“ Any type of data in string format.

The following example shows the implementation of the 'onClick' 
event listener to any element:


```

let data = "{\"identifier1\": \"test\",\"identifier2\": 1,\"identifier3\":true}"

self.tracker.trackCustomEvent("your-event-name", data: data);

```
